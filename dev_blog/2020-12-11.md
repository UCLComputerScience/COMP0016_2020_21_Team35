## Weekly meeting

We had our regular client meeting with Dr Connor, who helped to elaborate a few points:

- The device that our program is going to run on would be a PC with only Wi-Fi access
- Our program should allow user to install by "clicking through the options", without demanding manual configuration
- If possible, the UI should prompt user to log in with email and password
- A system architecture design diagram should also be done by next week

Again, a scratch done by Dr Connor during our meeting to help with understanding :)

## MoSCoW list

After weeks of discussion, we finalised the full MoSCoW list of our project which can be accessed [here](/dev_blog/moscow.md).

## **Next step**

Next week, we will look into 

- Create a system architecture design diagram
- Reach out to our TA and discuss about the UI options
- Look into an interface that connects Asterisk and speech-to-text solution
