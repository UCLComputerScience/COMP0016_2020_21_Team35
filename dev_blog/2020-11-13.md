## Client updates

Following up on the past week, we were able to reach more clients and interviewed Elisabeth Krymalowski from RCGP regarding the project requirements. 

We had a slight technical issue during the meeting. However, we did manage to run through our current plan for the solution which we'd discussed with Joseph. Elizabeth had some concerns about the project. Her specific issues were about how the system would be used, and specifically how we would manage to get the correct medical information and triages to run the project, since she wasn't aware any existed (these may take extensive research to create). She suggested we talked with Dr Stephanie Coughlin about these issues becasue as a clinician, she would likely be able to guide us.

We also had meetings with Joseph, where we mostly discussed the system we would use to develop the IVR. We found it very difficult to find a system that could be integrated an was open source. Joseph had told us previously that since we were only storing yes or no answers, we could potentially use the cloud to resolve these (speech to text). We suggested using Twilio to generate and run the IVR. However, Joseph informed us that it would be better if we could find an open source library since, a user may not just say yes or no, even though we only ask for that. Also there was still the problem of storing GP triage questions in the cloud for this solution.

- In the case when the patient is from the elderly group, back pain might be a potential signal of cancer.

## Research Update

From the feedback we received from Elizabeth, we decided to book a meeting with Stephanie Coughlin, which she agreed to have on 24/11/2020.

Joseph had made it quite clear that an open source library that doesn't run on the cloud would be a much improved option for the IVR. We had previously done some research where we had looked at an open souce software system called Asterisk. We continued to look into it's feasability as an IVR. Although considerably more complicated than the Twilio solution, this later became the foundation for our GP IVR program.

## **Human-Computer Interaction**

Despite following up with our clients, we also started to examine our project from the perspective of Human-Computer Interaction.

The assignment involves working as a group to design and evaluate a prototype for your software system. It involves all four stages in the development life cycle: discovering requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation.

### Discovering **requirements**

To better understand the portrait of our users, we brought up the topic during the meeting with our clients. Due to the current lockdown restrictions, we conducted semi-structured interviews with our clients from NHS, as well as gathering feedback from the patients by using anonymous questionnaire.

### **Personas**

We developed the personas of our system using the example template

### **Example: Patient**

### **Example: Receptionist**

### **Sketches (IVR system)**

Below are a few sketches done by Catalina which showcases our solution.

### Example: user interactions

### Example: Statistical analysis

### **Prototyping**

### Initial prototype

### Evaluations

We decided to take a heuristic approach to the evaluation, both due to Covid complications and the short time frame of the project. We had 6 experts who were used in the heuristic evaluation process.
