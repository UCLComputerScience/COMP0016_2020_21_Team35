## Client updates

Following up on the past week, we were able to reach more clients and interviewed Dr Stephanie Coughlin and Dr Elisabeth Krymalowski from RCGP regarding the project requirements. 

During our meeting, we ran through our plan for the solution which they were quite happy about. Namely, Dr Coughlin suggested that we should add some additional questions to the IVR system. For example, when the patient reports about back pain, the IVR system should run through an additional question (e.g. age of the patient) to make sure it's not a red flag.

- In the case when the patient is from the elderly group, back pain might be a potential signal of cancer

## **Human-Computer Interaction**

Despite following up with our clients, we also started to examine our project from the perspective of Human-Computer Interaction.

The assignment involves working as a group to design and evaluate a prototype for your software system. It involves all four stages in the development life cycle: discovering requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation.

### Discovering **requirements**

To better understand the portrait of our users, we brought up the topic during the meeting with our clients. Due to the current lockdown restrictions, we conducted semi-structured interviews with our clients from NHS, as well as gathering feedback from the patients by using anonymous questionnaire.

### **Personas**

We developed the personas of our system using the example template

### **Example: Patient**

### **Sketches (IVR system)**

Below are a few sketches done by Catalina which showcases our solution.

### **Prototyping**

### Evaluations

We decided to take a heuristic approach to the evaluation, both due to Covid complications and the short time frame of the project. We had 6 experts who were used in the heuristic evaluation process.
