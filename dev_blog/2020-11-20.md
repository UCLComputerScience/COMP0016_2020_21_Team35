## Teaching assistant meeting

At the beginning of this week, we met up with our assigned teaching assistant Maliththa Bulathwela. We briefly ran through our the progress we've made so far, and discussed about our next steps.

Namely, a few tasks were suggested as following:

- Finalise and formally agree the MoSCoW list with our clients
- Building a subset of the co-functionality of our project as a prototype
    - Extract a graph which explains how the IVR system works
- Rationalise alternative design options and decide the most sensible option

The meeting was very refreshing, and we will conduct similar weekly meeting with our TA from here.

## Weekly meeting

This week focuses on adjusting the requirements such that our project will satisfy the needs of GP surgeries and provide and right assistance. During our meeting with Dr Joseph Connor this week, we confirmed one of our key aspects – the patient who uses the IVR system should be direct to a receptionist or specialist within the GP practice, rather than A&E. This clear up on the matter has allowed us to clarify the vision of the project.

Due to the data governance regulations, we were unsure about whether a cloud based solution is possible. Having double checked with our instructor, we confirmed that taking “Yes” or “No” answer does not violate users’ privacy, which allows us to explore more options in the short time period given to build the project.

## **Next step**

Now that requirements are more clarified after our meeting, we will start researching into what our final solution will be. 

Below are the solutions we will further research on:

- Framework solutions available to use for the IVR system
- Speech-to-text technology which is appropriate to adapt for live input feeds

We are also looking forward to be in contact with another team, trying to make a Voiceflow diagram and eventually turn it into code that can be used to create an IVR system.
