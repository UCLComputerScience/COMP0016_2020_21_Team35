## Development blog

As mentioned previously, due to a shift in the project requirement, I decided to migrate our development blog from WordPress page to our team's GitHub repository with the use of Markdown language. Hopefully this would help present our development progress in a more organised and logical way :) 

Likewise, I will make a start on reconstructing our project website following this.
