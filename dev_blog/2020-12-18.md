## System Architecture Diagram

Following up on previous week, below are the system architecture diagrams designed by Max:

The first diagram shows how a `Voiceflow` diagram will be taken by interfacing with the `Voiceflow API`, changing the JSON format and then using that on the target machine to turn it into an IVR solution.

The second diagram shows how user would interact with the `Asterisk` system, which redirects the call to relevant contact accordingly and interface with the Mitel Systems the GP surgery already has in place.

At the moment these both work as two seperate software packages since when we first discussed requirements we were told it would be good if someone remote to the computer running the IVR could generate the Voiceflow JSON file. However, after some further discussions with Joseph, we decided that this may be unnecessary. At this point we are still in further discussions about whether it should be one or two systems.

Currently, we are still researching on the `Mitel` system in order to set the whole system up. Besides, a SIP provider is also required to take calls from patients in real life.

## Weekly **meeting**

After creating the prototype and the system architecture program, we showed Dr Connor a demo of what's working so far. Despite being happy with our progress, Dr Connor suggested we could use `IBM Watson` for speech-to-text solution replacing `Google API` which we are currently using. 

As mentioned above, we are currently conducting further research on the Mitel system that the GP surgery are using. As such, we requested further information such as the version of Mitel system running at the surgery, which Dr Connor agreed to get back over the next few weeks. Once we have this information, we can hopefully better customise our UI and makes it easier to set up by the user of our system.

## **Next step**

- As mentioned, our system is currently running based on two separate programs - which we hope to merge into one such that the whole project can be created by only clicking rather than running command lines
- The UI of our program are rather simple at the moment, which we hope to add more features (e.g. telephony settings) in the future to make it more user friendly
- We are also looking to develop a statistical analysis feature which would be useful to keep track of incoming call and perform
