## Weekly meeting

Our weekly meeting this week mainly discussed about our progress on finding the solution to "bundle" our whole program into a package for easier installing purpose - which we were able to make some progress using `Docker` as container.

Furthermore, we elaborate on the hardware required for testing our system, as well as the statistical analysis feature for incoming calls.

### Docker

So far, we managed to make Asterisk work on a docker image which runs on a Ubuntu virtual system. The Docker container can be built by running the following command:

`$ docker build -t repository-name/asterisk01 .`

(Note that the "repository-name" can be customised by user)

The Asterisk can then be launched by running the following command:

`$ docker run --name asterisk --net=host -d -t repository-name/asterisk01`

To execute it, an additional command needs to be ran:

`$ docker exec -it asterisk asterisk -rvvvvv`

## **Next step**

Aside from Asterisk, next week we will also look into dockerising the supporting programs by creating additional Docker containers. 

In order to get the whole system working, one particular problem we are facing is the way to plug the telephone line/mitel system into the Asterisk. From what we've known so far, a telephony interface card is required to plug existing phoneline into our asterisk server, which we will research further on as one of our next steps.
