## Weekly meeting

This week, we had a meeting with our teaching assistant to update on our progress and double checked a few project requirements. Due to a schedule conflict, our meeting with Dr Connor was shifted to next week. Below are the the progress we have made for the previous week.

### Docker

Following up from previous week, we managed to further progress on bundling the whole system. At the moment, our program runs in two separate docker containers - one for `Asterisk`, configuration file and speech to text program; one for the main program with features that convert Voiceflow to JSON file to IVR.

### Project website

Besides the main program, we also made a start on our project website. After confirming the final submission form (static HTML file) with our TA, we realised the framework we have been using are not quite suitable as some features on the dynamic site are disabled on static form. 

As such, we decided to switch to another web framework and rebuild the project website, as well as the development blog.

## Next step

We collected a few essential hardware requirements for testing our system as followed, which hopefully will be available over the next few weeks.

- A [telephony interface card](https://www.asterisk.org/products/telephony-interface-cards/) (required for plugging the phone line in)
- A 1 GHz x86, 512 MB [RAM](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/asterisk-the-future/9780596510480/ch02.html) (required for preparing a system for `Asterisk`)
