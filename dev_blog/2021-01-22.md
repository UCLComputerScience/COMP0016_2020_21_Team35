After finishing elevator pitch last week, we are back to regular developing cycle.

## Weekly meeting

During our meeting with Dr Connor this week, we further elaborate on the idea of setting up our program on users' device. Namely, Dr Connor provided additional information on the device which our program are expected to be run on - a PC with linux system installed, plugged in to internet with ISDN line.

As previously discussed, the back-end user of our system is likely to be someone who has no background in programming. As such, it is essential to bundle up the whole project into a package which allows user to install without prior knowledge (as Dr Connor said "as little intervention as possible"). 

To sum up, currently our project includes:

- Asterisk
- Supporting program written in Python
- Configuration interface

Users should be able to:

- Configure which telephone extension to work on a setting page (UI)

## **Next steps**

As discussed during our client meeting, our next steps are as followed:

- Find ways to test our program, preferably with a phone line plugged in
- Find ways to "bundle up" our program, making it easier for user to install
- Develop a drag-and-drop feature for JSON file in our program which allows users to easily set up the extensions
- Create a list of hardware requirements for testing
