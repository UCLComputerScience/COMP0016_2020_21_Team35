## Client updates

Over the past two weeks, we successfully made contact with a number of our clients via email and interviewed Dr Joseph Connor from NHS. The meeting clarified the confusion we had on starting the project, and allowed us to further understand the purpose of our project as well as clarifying the requirements.

Besides, Dr Atia Rafiq has also responded to my email but was not able to meet with us this week due to schedule conflict. 

## Progress check

We created a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lCapk3IL/t35-th1400-gp-ivr) which includes all members and our client Dr Connor to keep track on our progress. A GitHub repository is also created for our project which is available [here](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team35).

## **Meeting notes (2020-10-30)**

The first thing we discussed with Joseph was what the problem was that we were trying to solve, we were told that due to Covid 19, the number of calls to GP surgeries had on average increaded by 200%. In addition to this he told us that 79% of MSK (muscolo-skeletal) problems are handled with at A&E or in by a physio and no directly by a GP.

Thi lead us to a brainstorming session to help understand what we were going to build. It would be an IVR system that would have a triage of questions, which could then redirect a user to the appropriate place, rather than sending all patients through to the receptionist. The hope was that this would decrease the call queue times at GP surgeries. After discussing about the potential solutions, it was agreed that it was more realistic to build our project upon an existing framework for IVR (interactive voice response) system that only requires yes/no answers, rather than creating the entire system from scratch.

Below is a sketch made by Dr Connor to help visualise of our project, which would be extremely useful to help us map out our system architecture.

Overall, we are looking to build a system as followed:

- An IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system that directs incoming call to the right department accordingly
    - e.g. someone with back pain to the A&E department
- The system should also be able to deal with multiple incoming calls at the same time
- UI is also recommended such that the back-end user (receptionist/GP) can modify information as needed
    - e.g. changing the content of call triage

We also discussed that GDPR would play a large role in the project, as a patient's voice could not be stored on the cloud, as well as any information added or changed in the call triage by a receptionist. This would mean both text to speech during the IVR and speech to text to generate the triage would have to be doing locally without using cloud services such as Google APIs.

## **Next step**

For the rest of this week, we will start looking for existing framework for an IVR that we could use to develop the solution. Additionally, we will try to reach more clients to collect all of the requirements our clients have and condense them down into our final MoSCoW requirements.
