## Client updates

Over the past two weeks, we successfully made contact with a number of our clients via email and interviewed Dr Joseph Connor from NHS. The meeting clarified the confusion we had on starting the project, and allowed us to further understand the purpose of our project as well as clarifying the requirements.

Besides, Dr Atia Rafiq has also responded to my email but was not able to meet with us this week due to schedule conflict. 

## Progress check

We created a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lCapk3IL/t35-th1400-gp-ivr) which includes all members and our client Dr Connor to keep track on our progress. A GitHub repository is also created for our project which is available [here](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team35).

## **Meeting notes (2020-10-30)**

During our first meeting with Dr Connor, we had a brainstorming session to help understand what we are to build. After discussing about the potential solutions, we all agreed that it is more realistic to build our project upon an existing framework for IVR (interactive voice response) system that only requires yes/no answer, rather than creating the entire system from scratch.

Below is a scratch made by Dr Connor to help visualise of our project, which I found to be quite interesting.

Overall, we are looking to build a system as followed:

- An IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system that directs incoming call to the right department accordingly
    - e.g. someone with back pain to the A&E department
- The system should also be able to deal with multiple incoming calls at the same time
- UI is also recommended such that the back-end user (receptionist/GP) can modify information as needed
    - e.g. changing the content of response

Besides, all personal data during the call should be only processed by the system rather than stored.

## **Next step**

For the rest of this week, we will start looking for existing framework for IVR that we could use to develop the solution. Additionally, we will try to reach more clients to collect as much requirement as possible.
