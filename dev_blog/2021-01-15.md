This week's development blog will update the progress we have made during the Christmas break and the elevator pitch we conducted on Friday this week.

## Weekly meeting

Despite the regular meeting with our teaching assistant, we also had a brief catch up with our supervisor Dr Yun Fu and updated on our progress. During the meeting, we showed a demo of what has been working so far and our plan for the upcoming weeks.

## Next Steps

Currently we have a prototype where a user can login to the voiceflow through a very basic UI. They can then choose their workspace and project from Voiceflow, click "Create Config" and then an IVR will be created. You are then able to call the IVR, giving yes and no responses to questions. Still it only works with Google API. Also it is only working locally, meaning that you need a softphone on the local network that has been manually configured in order to call the IVR.

Some major research and development will be need to swap out from Google API and move from a manually configured local network.

The next step will be to move away from Google API and to open source and offline software packages.

## **Elevator pitch**

In the first week of term 2, we successfully prepared a 2 minutes presentation and delivered the elevator pitch to fellow students, clients and module leads to showcase our solution. 

After preparing for the presentation and completed the pre-recorded video, we invited all our clients for the presentation pitch happened on Friday 15-01-2021. Below is the PowerPoint slides used during our presentation.

We prepared the PowerPoint slide deck together and I was also responsible for editing the video. Overall, the presentation went smoothly and we received positive feedback from two of our client, Dr Elisabeth Krymalowski and Dr Stephanie Coughlin from RCGP.
