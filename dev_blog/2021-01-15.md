This week's development blog will update the progress we have made during the Christmas break and the elevator pitch we conducted on Friday this week.

## Weekly meeting

Despite the regular meeting with our teaching assistant, we also had a brief catch up with our supervisor Dr Yun Fu and updated on our progress. During the meeting, we showed a demo of what has been working so far and our plan for the upcoming weeks.

## **Elevator pitch**

In the first week of term 2, we successfully prepared a 2 minutes presentation and delivered the elevator pitch to fellow students, clients and module leads to showcase our solution. 

After preparing for the presentation and completed the pre-recorded video, we invited all our clients for the presentation pitch happened on Friday 15-01-2021. Below is the PowerPoint slides used during our presentation.

We prepared the PowerPoint slide deck together and I was also responsible for editing the video. Overall, the presentation went smoothly and we received positive feedback from two of our client, Dr Elisabeth Krymalowski and Dr Stephanie Coughlin from RCGP.
