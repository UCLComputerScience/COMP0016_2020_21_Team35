## Recap

Continuing from last week, we have been actively doing research on topics as followed:

- Framework solutions we could use for the IVR system
- Text-to-speech technology which is appropriate to adapt for live input feeds

## Open-source IVR research

After we confirmed our development approach with Dr Connor, we began to research the existing IVR framework that are available to use. So far, we managed to shortlist the following options:

### Asterisk

- Asterisk is an open source software which essentially turns our device into a communication server
- The software requires an input audio file rather than generating speech from plain text

### Twilio

- A cloud communications platform that allows us to programmatically make and receive phone calls with the use of web service APIs
- Often used together with Python

## Text-to-speech & speech-to-text

Following our research last week, below are the options of both text-to-speech and speech-to-text solutions we found:

### Mozilla DeepSpeech

Below are the upside of Mozilla DeepSpeech:

- Open source Tensorflow-based speech-to-text processor
- Has pre-trained English model available for use
- Both audio recordings and live speech can be turned into text
- Multiple programming languages, including Python
- Better awareness of privacy concerns
- Has a remarkable per-word error rate of near about 6.5%

### Pyttsx3

- pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in python
- Unlike similar alternative libraries, it works offline, which satisfies our requirement for NOT processing users' information on cloud system

Both options for IVR framework and text-to-speech solutions will be further discussed with our clients in the following week.

## Weekly meeting

During our meeting this week, Dr Connor also suggested we should test both system with the text-to-speech solution to see which one works better in terms of audio quality and data regulation concerns.

## Next step

For the rest of this week, we will look into developing a prototype for our IVR solution as well as finalising our MoSCoW list with the clients.
