## COMP0016(2020-2021) Team35 

Hi there! We are team 35 of the COMP0016 System Engineering module and welcome to our GitHub repository.

## Project introduction

### Our project
>RCGP x IBM - "ARI NLP Tools" - an open source NLP engine for facilitating and improving interactive services with GP call queues

### Project brief
> Working with team 34's "ARI" graphics project, this team (team 35) will work on the NLP mining of live audio call questions that take place when patients call into GP clinics. Live transcription and multilingual transcription feeds will be generated using open source tools. ARI NLP will also have a REST interface for enabling data sourced feedback into the live AR call, with automated chat data responses linking to a patient database via FHIR.
