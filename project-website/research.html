                After the initial meeting with our clients, we both agreed that it is more realistic to build the "ARI NLP tool" based on an exisiting open-source IVR framework considering the scale of the project. Besides, we are also looking for speech-to-text solutions in order to translate user's voice message to plain text, which will later be analysed by the IVR system and redirect the user to corresponding place.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each part, we would first conduct a related projects review and search for existing projects that are similar to our solution. After finding suitable solutions, we then conduct a technology review and compare each of the solution by its pros and cons - This includes the programming languages, frameworks and libraries we used throughout the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                To sum up, the main part of our research are the followings:

                Considering the heavy use of external libraries and frameworks in our project, it is crucial to pick programming language that provides reliable structure, great usability and safety since we are processing sensitive user information. Despite the performance, we also kept in mind the simplicity of the language. As the project could later be used by other purposes, it is important to keep the documentation simple, readable and easily adaptable.

            <p>After reviewing multiple existing IVR projects on GitHub, one common factor for most solutions we found is the usage of Asterisk. Some opensource options we&#39;ve also considered include 3CX and FusionPBX, which are quite similar to Asterisk. However, consider most related solution we&#39;ve come across adapted Asterisk, it is easier to follow the existing code for safety concerns.</p>
            <h3 id="technology-review">Technology review</h3>
            <p>The following are the reasons we chose Asterisk</p>
            <ul>
            <li>It is an open source software which essentially turns the device into a communication server</li>
            <li>The software requires an input audio file rather than generating speech from plain text, which is ideal for our project</li>
            <li>It has a variety range of functionalities including call Forward on Busy, call Forward on No Answer, call monitoring/recording, etc. which covers all our requirements</li>
            <li>It comes with an internal language, dialplan, which can be used to implement extra features<ul>
            <li>For example, in our MoSCoW list one of the Could haves is a statistical analysis feature - which we implemented using the dialplan</li>

                <p>Twilio is a widely used solution that allows software developers to make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions programmatically using its web service APIs.</p>
                <h3 id="technology-review">Technology review</h3>
                <p>The following are the reasons we chose Twilio:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Comparing to communication online, the telephony network runs in a relatively closed, slow-moving, and expensive ecosystem. It involves with the usage of SIP carriers, networks and hardwares which is difficult to configure.<ul>
                <li>With Twilio, we only need to set up a Twilio numbe, provider IP address and ports - the rest is handled by Twilio.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It is easy to configure and the cost is relatively low compare to other similar solutions</li>
                <li>It can be used together with multiple programming language, including Python</li>

            <p>With the API created, we started to research on opensource speech-to-text engines available to use. After evaluating the functionality and successful rate (in translating), we found the following solutions that fit the requirements of our project</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Mozilla DeepSpeech</li>
            <li>IBM Watson</li>
            <li>Google API</li>
            <li>Pocketsphinx</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="technology-review">Technology Review</h2>
            <h4 id="mozilla-deepspeech">Mozilla DeepSpeech</h4>
            <p>Mozilla DeepSpeech is an open-source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on Baidu&#39;s Deep Speech research paper.</p>
            <p>Initially, we chose DeepSpeech as our primary solution as it supports multiple programming languages (including Python) and has a pre-trained English model available for use.</p>
            <p>However, at later stage we found the package size for DeepSpeech is too large for a language model (900+ MB), which makes it less suitable to our solution as we intend to bundles everything into an easy-to-install package.</p>
            <p>Moreover, DeepSpeech has a great performance in translating voice for audio with a rate of 16kHz. However, the regular telephone audio is sampled at 8kHz, and in such cases the DeepSpeech model doesn&#39;t work very well - even if the audio is upscaled to 16kHz. The successful rate of detect &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer is only around 60% of the time.</p>
            <h4 id="ibm-watson-google-api">IBM Watson &amp; Google API</h4>
            <p>Both solutions performed very well at translating the voice from file stream, resulting in a much greater chance in detecting &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer. However, neither solution perform as well in the case when the audio is not as clear, which could happen very often in real life due to various reasons.</p>
            <p>Additionally, both engines are essentially cloud solution, which is against our requirements due to the GDPR. Although IBM Watson offers a choice to store data offline, it still requires the use of internet.</p>
            <h4 id="pocketsphinx">Pocketsphinx</h4>
            <p>Pocketsphinx is a part of the CMU Sphinx open source toolkit for speech recognition. The solution was proven to be highly inaccurate in detecting exact text. However, the solution allows user to set particular words to look for. For example, when detecting the speech from Asterisk, the phrase we look for would be &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;yep&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot; and many more, increasing the possibility of getting the right answer. For such reason, a list of phrase was compiled for &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answer which makes it easier for Pocketsphinex to detect compare to generic sentence.</p>
            <p>After testing, the solution was proven to be detecting more &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answer than it&#39;s supposed to be. Although it&#39;s not perfect, it still has an extremely high accuracy rate compare to other options. (Note: This does require using a separate open source speech model for 8kHz sample rate as well as upscaling the sample rate of the audio to 16kHz)</p>
            <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
            <p>Overall, Pocketsphinx has a much higher rate of detecting correct answers compare to the alternative options. It is proven to be the most suitable option out of all four engines we have been looking into. As such, we decided to apply it to our project to detect the content of the audio file from Asterisk. The system now outputs &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;unsure&quot; depending on the speech-to-text result.</p>

              To sum up, with a detailed evaluation for each part of the project and a two-step review, we were able to determine the most suitable solutions for our project. Namely, with the use of a modern programming language Python, we ensure the adaptablity and simplicity for future code reuse. The use of both Asterisk and Twilio help achieved the main functionalities of the project. Together with the carefully picked speech-to-text solution, we aim to deliver a secured and easy-to-use software to our clients.
