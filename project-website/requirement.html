                The RCGP "ARI NLP Tool" is an open source NLP engine for facilitating and improving interactive services with GP call queues. It aims to provide users with a more simplified and efficient solution for booking appointment with GP surgery by introducing the interactive voice response system. 
          </p>
              
            <p>
                The IVR system would take users requests by analysing their answers to pre-set questions, then direct them to the corresponding place. It significantly improves users' experience and help reduces the current massive workload of front-desk receptionsts at GP practice.

                To better understand the requirements from our clients, we set up seperate meetings with each of the client from both NHS and RCGP in the first few weeks. During the meetings, we discussed about the potential application and the exact features that are required in the final project. After some further clarification about ambiguities, we were able to compile a MoSCoW list over the course of the meetings as requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the questions we asked during the interview include:
                <li>What the existing telephoney system that's currently used within the GP practice?</li>
                <li>What operation system should our final solution expected to be run on? Window, Linus, Ubuntu? </li>
                <li>Is there any regulation we should be aware of since the project consists handling patients' information?</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from interviewing with clients, we also gathered some insights from the "patients" via anonymous questionnaires. Due to the current lockdown situation, we decided to conduct the research online by asking fellow students to fill in the Google form we provided and analyse their answers afterwards. This method was suggested by Dr Chris Evans, the HCI lecturer of the module.

                  <strong>Q: </strong>Is there any existing project that is currently in used that's similar to our solution?
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>A: </strong>Depending on the GP surgery, at the moment most appointments are made by the online booking system. But most likely our receptionists will have to call back and double check the exact symptoms with each patient.

                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>A: </strong>Yes, some additional questions should asked when necessary. Take back pain for an example, it's important to ask the patient's age as a subsequent question. Especially for elderly patients, back pain is considered to be a red flag which might indicate some more severe problems.

                  <strong>A: </strong>Yes, due to the GDPR regulation, it is necessary that the data processing is conducted offline - meaning you need to prevent the use of cloud solution.

          <p>Following our interview with the clients and the answers we gathered from online questionnaires, we were able to create some potential use cases of our project as shown below:</p>

                  John is a 40-year-old male who has long been suffering for his back pain. 
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                  Due to this reoccuring issue, John has been using the current NHS phone system to book appointments with a physio for a long time. John wants to book the appointment in one go rather than going back and forth and explain his symptoms every time. 
                  
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                   With the "ARI NLP tool", John is now directed to an IVR system when calling the local GP number. Instead of waiting in the massive call queue, he found himself successfully redirected to the physio after answering a few questions.

                  Sarah is a 31-year-old receptionist who works at a local GP surgery. Her responsibilities include directing patients to the right services.  However, the online booking system  does not represent patient’s symptoms clearly. Additionally, due to the pandemic, there has been a surge in incoming calls requesting COVID test, which causes massive workload to redirect caLLS.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                    With the "ARI NLP tool", the booking process is now fully automatic. Sarah only needs to log in the system with credentials and configure the numbers that patients will be directed to. The setting process of IVR is also very simple, which can easily done by drop-and-drop the Voiceflow file.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                    Additionally, Sarah found the statistical analysis feature very useful, as it provides a direct visualisation of how many incoming calls were answered today, as well as other status including not answered/user busy or call failed.

                        <li>UI should show the call date, total number of calls and the number of calls going to each end point of the IVR. This will be displayed on the computer where the IVR sits.</li>
                        <li>There should be the option for the receptionist at the GP surgery (or someone else) to input their own recorded messages for the IVR (rather than using the automatic text to speech ones). They will record the messages elsewhere and then using a particular file type (such as .MP3 or .WAV) they will be able to add these in place of the automatic messages.</li>
                        <li>A section of the UI which allows the user to change the telephony system in place as well as relevant redirecting numbers. This will allow GP surgeries with a variety (if not all) telephony systems to use our IVR system easily through the UI settings.</li>
                        <li>A section of the UI should allow us to see specifically why calls were cut off during the IVR if they were. We should be able to specifically see whether the user hung-up during the IVR or if they didn’t get to the end for another reason (such as connection issues).</li>

                    <ul class="">
                        <li>Information from IVR sent to relevant people in the surgery (in the form of reports to the person who the patient is being redirected to).</li>
                        <li>More sophisticated statistical analysis of the data in order to help the GP surgery know where most patients are going through to, the times of day etc. Collecting this into nice formats and reports with graphs that can easily be analysed by someone working at the surgery.</li>
                        <li>Being able to change the JSON file on the Linux machine running the IVR remotely. This would allow a receptionist to much more easily change the IVR.</li>
                        <li>Being able to change the telephony settings of the system remotely.</li>
                        <li>Being able to review reports and statistics of the system remotely.</li>

                        <li>Won’t have our own speech to text model (again, using external library).</li>
