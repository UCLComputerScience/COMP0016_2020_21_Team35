                There are various forms of testing that we used in our system including unit and regression tests and tests to make sure the UI and all buttons were functioning correctly. We also had some manual tests that were not possible to automate.
            </p>
            <p>
                To sum up, the testing methods we adapted are the followings:

                Our general testing strategy was to have a collection of regression tests which we would run periodically and add to as new features were added. When we ran these, we could determine if new changes to the system had broken any previously implemented features. We also had manual testing such as for speech to text, simultaneous calls and other features that occurred throughout the process as well as more thoroughly at the end of the project. All of this testing, both manual and automated was run many times throughout the process, usually after adding large features or making moderate changes to the system. This allowed us to find the cause of bugs quickly and effectively, minimising debugging time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we finished developing the project, we also added a suite of unit and integration tests and test cases that tested the UI functionality. Unit tests were specifically to test whether each particular part of the system was functioning as it should. Integration tests were used test whether different parts of the system were working together effectively as they should. We did not manage to totally finish these test suites and they are still a working progress. This is something we would improve if we had slightly more time on the project, in order to get 100% test coverage of the system.</p>

          <h2>General Code Testing</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>All our testing code is written in python, mostly because all of our project code is also in python. We used the python Pytest framework for all our unit and integration tests. For our UI functionality tests we used a mixture of QTest and Unittest. QTest is python module used to test PyQt applications, simulating keystrokes, mouse clicks and mouse movement. Unittest and Pytest are python modules used to easily write and execute test cases for your code in python. 
            </p>
            <p>It was extremely important for us to test the actual functionality of the UI so that we know that users interacting with the UI can actually click buttons, navigate to pages and use the entire system as intended. This goes above and beyond simply testing whether the backend functionality behind the UI works correctly, which we test with unit and integration tests.</p>
            <p>We also used Coverage.py as a code coverage tool for our python tests. This allowed us to see how much of our code we had actually written unit and integration tests for and where we were lacking. As mentioned, we did not manage to get 100% coverage in the end, but this is something we would work on further if we had more time on the project.</p>

        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>Our user acceptance testing was mostly done by our main project partner, Joseph Connor. It was important to show Joseph the project and let him test it so that we would know if it met the requirements and standards that he expected. Joseph did not have an Ubuntu computer and requested that we were able to set up the program on a Linode server. We did this for him. Initially we required Joseph to install a separate piece of software on his machine in order to run the program on the Linode server. Joseph was not so happy about this and told us that people may not feel comfortable installing a separate piece of software they did not know about on their machine. We took this point extremely seriously and within a couple of days we had simplified the process of running the program on a Linode system. Now you could simply click a desktop application and you didn’t need to install any additional software. When we showed Joseph this, he was extremely satisfied about the solution. When describing his thoughts on the final solution, he said that it went above and beyond what he expected and that it’s uses within the NHS extended much further than the original scope of the project. If we had more time, it would have been great to have done more user testing and get feedback from actual users from within the NHS.</p>

        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>Compatibility testing was simply making sure that the system ran on a Linux computer. We knew the specs of the computer needed to run the Asterisk system, depending on call traffic from extensive research that we had done. We tested that the system would work on an Ubuntu system or Linode server a number of times manually. Our client did not require that it was able to run on any other operating system or server.</p>

          <h2>Performance/Stress Testing</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>The only performance or stress testing that we had to complete was to test whether multiple calls worked simultaneously on the system. We knew from research how many calls would work for a given piece of hardware, but we needed to know whether multiple people could call the system simultaneously. When we first developed the project and tested this, we found this was not the case. The program either got confused and gave the wrong “yes” or “no” answer to the wrong person calling or one person’s answer was not picked up in the IVR. With 3 or more callers this got even worse. We figured out that the problem was that we needed to turn our speech to text API into a multithreaded application and that we needed to differentiate between speech files to make them unique for each call. This was so that they did not overwrite each other simultaneously. We fixed this issue, allowing for as many simultaneous calls as possible by the hardware. After fixing this bug, whenever changes were made to the Asterisk part of the system, we did this test manually with 3 simultaneous calls. This was to make sure that this part of the system was not broken by any changes.</p>
            <p>We also had many issues trying to get our speech to text effectively telling whether the user said “yes” or “no” during the IVR. In order to test this, once it was implemented, we completed a manual test trial with 5 users. How PocketSphinx works is that it will look for certain words that a user said that are specified by us in a config file – these are “yes” and “no” words. It then sums how many times the user says these words and then decides from this whether the user said “yes” or “no”. We can change the importance values of these words, making them more or less likely to be noticed. We tested by asking 5 users to answer “yes” and “no” to the system on their various devices (smart phones). We then looked at how many of these answers were guessed correctly by our model. We then adjusted the numbers to favour “yes” or “no” depending on what the results favoured. We repeated this process 5 times in order to improve the model. Even after this we found that it quite often does not guess “yes” or “no” correctly for new voices. If we had more time and resources, we would complete a much larger and lengthy study in order to improve the accuracy of the model.</p>
