            <h3>Full Architecture</h3>
            <p>Above is an image showing the full architecture of our system. It shows each subsection of the solution and how they each work with each other to create a fully functioning solution. The system is split into various parts and there are two types of user.</p> 
             <p>The first type of user is a user who will interact with the user interface on the Linux Computer or Server. This UI is used to change the IVR call triage in place, change the IVR and telephone provider settings, view analytics about the IVR system and view the status or turn the IVR server on or off.</p>
             <p>The second type of user is a user who calls up the IVR system using the appropriate telephone number. In our deployment we have tested with a Twilio telephone number. The user calls the Twilio telephone number, this then sends them to the IVR which gives them a triage of questions to which they can respond “Yes” or “No”. After getting to an end point of the IVR, they are then redirect to the relevant resource or number through Twilio.</p>

            <h3>Voiceflow to JSON API</h3>
            <p>Voiceflow is an online web application used to make flow diagrams, such as those used in and IVR. </p>
            <p>The <code>Voiceflow to JSON API</code> is an API that we have written to make HTTP requests to the <code>Voiceflow REST API</code>, get out the workspaces and projects for an account, that we can display to the user and then get out the diagram for a project in a JSON format that we can decode. The Voiceflow Rest API does not have any documentation, therefore in order to figure out how to use this we had to manually look at the browser’s network in order to see what HTTP requests Voiceflow itself makes to the REST API.</p>
            <p>From doing this analysis of the Voiceflow REST API, we figured that we could get the workspaces and projects for a user as long as we had their credentials. We use the python requests library in order to send HTTP requests to the server.</p>
            <p>In order to get information about a specific user, you first have to authenticate the user by sending a put request to the server containing a JSON payload with the user’s email and password. We then get out a JSON response which contains an authorization token. We then use this as a header in each of our ongoing responses to get out information specifically for the user’s account. </p>
            <p>We can then send a GET request for the user’s workspaces which we show on the UI. Once the user chooses a workspace, we can then send a GET request for the projects related to that workspace. When a user selects a project, we can then send another GET request to the REST API to get the Voiceflow diagram in a JSON format. This can then be decoded and re-encoded by our JSON Encoding API.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
          
          
        <div>
            <h3>JSON Encoding API</h3>
            <p>The <code>JSON encoding API</code> is used to decode Voiceflow diagram JSON that we get using the Voiceflow to JSON API. We then re-encode this into our own much more simplified version, that we developed in order to very easily create the Dialplan code needed to create an IVR on Asterisk.</p>
            <p>This works by stripping out all of the information that is not useful to us in the Voiceflow JSON and simplifying the format. The final result simply has a list of nodes and each node has a list of dialogs, children and choices, if applicable. These are the only useful pieces of information needed by us to create an IVR. </p>
            <p>In a Voiceflow diagram, an intent is the choice that someone can choose. For our IVR, only “yes” and “no” are allowed, however in Voiceflow JSON, any choice is allowed, and these are encoded with a random list of alphanumeric characters in the JSON. We are required to use more GET requests to get what these encodings mean. This also allows us to do error checking here, as answers other than “yes” and “no” are not allowed. Also, more than two choices is not allowed.</p>
            <p>Once we have re-encoded the JSON here, we can pass it back to the UI which will the send it to the JSON to Dialplan API to make actual changes to the IVR on the Asterisk system.</p>
        </div>
          
        <div>
            <h3>JSON to Dialplan API</h3>
            <p>The <code>JSON to Dialplan API</code> simply takes the simplified Voiceflow JSON we generate, transforms it into Dialplan code that allows the IVR to function properly and writes the code to the <code>“extensions.conf”</code> file in the Asterisk system.</p>
            <p>The first section of the Dialplan sets up the caller. It allows any number to call the IVR as long as it is in the UK. This then sets Asterisk to direct the caller to the first message in the IVR. Then the speech file is played. Once done, the audio from the call is recorded by the speech to text API, when the speaking stops, the recording stops and <code>PocketSphinx</code> analyses the speech, looking for “yes” and “no” words. Then it returns “yes” or “no” which then determines where the caller is sent in the IVR according to the Dialplan. We use the node key values from the original JSON because they are unique, so this makes good sense for the IVR Dialplan code.</p>
            <p>When this code has been written in the conf file on Asterisk, our API then connects to the Asterisk AGI manager using the <code>pyst2</code> library and runs the Asterisk command to reload the Dialplan code. This is necessary in order for the IVR to update on the Asterisk system so callers can access it.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
          
        <div>
            <h3>Checking API Server Status</h3>
            <p>We need to check the status of the IVR, whether it is offline or online so that the user can easily view this. We do this using the python docker library which uses the <code>Docker SDK</code>. Using this we can check the status of the docker container which in turn tells us the status of the IVR, whether the container is running or not. If the docker container with the name specified cannot be found by the Docker API, we build the docker container from a downloaded Docker image, using the python library <code>client.containers.run()</code> command. Here we specify all of the local volumes we want to use as storage on the Docker container. We can also specify for the container to use “host” network mode so that the relevant ports that Asterisk uses are forwarded onto the Docker container by the host machine.</p>
            <p>We also have functions to stop and start the IVR container. We do this by finding the container with the specified name using the python docker library and then using the <code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code> functions, also in the python docker library.</p>
            <p>We check the Docker container status every 5 seconds from the UI in order to show up to date information about the status to the user, but not use too much processing power by checking it more often. This is only checked if the user is on the IVR Status page of the UI. It is important not to use too much processing power from the UI because the same computer also has to run the IVR. Using too much processing power at the same time could cause the IVR call system to not work as well for users, especially if there is a high volume of current callers.</p>

            <h3>PyQt5</h3>
            <p><code>PyQt5</code> is a python library for creating GUI applications with python. We decided to use PyQt5 because it had nicer UIs and it allowed for easy separation of the functionality from the UI. This is unlike the other main python library used for this purpose, TKinter.</p>
            <p>We have a separate class for each page on the UI, with a method to initiate the UI and then relevant functions for interactions and setup of the UI. Each of these classes inherits from the <code>PyQt5 QWidget class</code>. We then have a main UI class which is used to organise the connections between all of these pages and set them up when they are needed. The pages act as a widget which is displayed as the central widget of the UI. This gives the effect of the entire UI changing, whereas in reality only the central widget of the main UI class changes. This means that we can have the Menu available on any page, even though it is set up only in the main UI class.</p>
            <p>The UI is used to interact with all of the APIs that we’ve created, both to get the simplified Voiceflow diagram and to make changes to all of the settings and get analytics, when the user requires it to do so. It does this by calling methods in our various API classes.</p>

          <h2>Packaging the solution</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
            <h3>Ubuntu Docker Container for Asterisk</h3>
            <p>We use a Docker Container using an <code>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS image  </code>to run Asterisk. Generally, Asterisk is quite complicated to setup, requires many libraries to be installed on the machine as well as moving around and adding to various directories. Furthermore, Asterisk is made to work on a Linux operating system. One of our requirements from our client was for the end solution to be packaged up in a way that was easy to run. We therefore decided to use Docker so that all dependencies and any configuration could be set up automatically when building our image.</p>
            <p>In the Docker image, we install all the dependencies, including asterisk. We then make the relevant directories that are required and make changes where they are needed. This then sets up the Asterisk environment, ready for an IVR. When running the container, we also set it in “host” network mode which is incredibly important so that incoming traffic is forwarded by the host machine to the Docker container. Furthermore, we set specific volumes local to the host to be in the correct file locations within the Docker container, as to allow us to easily manipulate and change settings and the IVR in place.</p>
            <p>When the Docker image is run or started, Asterisk automatically starts, which allows the IVR system to function. We encountered many, many issues when trying to get Asterisk working with Docker, mostly regarding networking issues. One of our initial plans was to see if we could get the Docker image working on a Windows or Mac machine and although we did get this working and it was possible, due to a current bug with Docker on Windows and Mac, this would result in severe security vulnerabilities with the system. This bug has been ongoing with the Docker community for 5 years and recently they have announced that they have added fixing this to their list of priorities (early 2021). This means hopefully within the next year or so when that has been fixed by Docker, you would also be able to run this system on Windows and Mac without any security vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p>We also encountered issues to do with a router (BT in this case) not forwarding on signals on particular ports to host machines and docker containers. This meant that calls were not being put through to the IVR or in some cases would end after 30 seconds. This was fixed in the end by adding port forwarding rules to the router firewall settings. We found that these issues did not occur when deploying on Linode. We let our client know of these issues, and if a user faced similar difficulties, it would likely be with their router, so they also would need to add a port forwarding rule on their router for ports 5160 and 5060.</p>

          <h2>Speech-to-text solution</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
            <h3>Using PocketSphinx for Speech to Text</h3>
            <p>Using <code>PocketSphinx</code> we developed an API that could interface with the Asterisk system.</p>
            <p>We first open an audio stream to connect to the Asterisk system and wait for a user to start talking. When the user starts talking, we record their speech and when the system doesn’t hear any more speech, it stops recording. We then pass this recorded file into PocketSphinx to find whether the user says “yes” or “no”. We do this by counting the number of “yes” and “no” words that the user was heard to say and then depending on which they said more of is the outcome that is returned. This “yes” or “no” answer is then assigned to a channel variable on the Asterisk system which can then be read by Asterisk for the specific channel of the call. This is then used in the Dialplan code to decide where in the IVR the user will move to next.</p>
            <p>One issue we faced later on when testing the system is we found that it would not work for simultaneous calls. If two people called at the same time, their speech to text would either get muddled up with the other person, or more often it wouldn’t work at all.</p>
            <p>We later found that there were two issues that were causing this. Firstly, we needed to create audio files of different names, so that they didn’t get mixed up when people calling would write to the same audio file. We simply did this by creating unique audio files for each call, depending on the channel the call was in, which was unique to the call and could be taken using Dialplan code and sent to this AGI script.</p>
            <p>The second issue was of the case we currently couldn’t run two instances of the same speech to text class simultaneously. We fixed this by using multithreading in the python code to create a concurrent system. This then allowed as many concurrent calls as capable by the computer’s processor to run at the same time. This completely fixed this problem of simultaneous calls and now many concurrent calls work perfectly fine on the system. The only limitation would be the hardware that is being used and the number of concurrent calls that the telephone number provider allows. Therefore, the limitation is no longer with our software or system.</p>

            <h3>Converting Text to Speech using PicoTTS</h3>
            <p><code>PicoTTS</code> is a python-based speech to text library that can be used to convert text to speech in an audio wav format locally, without use of the cloud. You must however have pico2wave binary installed on the system to use the library. We package up pico2wave in our “.deb” file as a dependency, meaning the user automatically installs this when installing the application.</p>
            <p>As specified as one of our requirements, we had to do the text to speech locally, without using cloud resources and PicoTTS does this. We initially tried using pytts3 while we were developing on Windows. On Windows this works extremely well but when testing on Ubuntu, we found it uses eSpeak to create the speech which sounds terrible and incredibly unnatural. We therefor experimented with some other libraries for text to speech, out of which, PicoTTS sounded the most natural on an Ubuntu operating system, which is where the program would run.</p>
            <p>Our program works by using the JSON in the simplified Voiceflow diagram, which is given to this API from the JSON to Dialplan API one point at a time within the IVR. We then convert that text into a .wav file for each point in the IVR and change the frequency of the audio to 8000 kHz which is the sampling rate of telephony audio. Once the file is ready, it can be stored in the correct location on the Asterisk system for it to be used by the Dialplan for use in the IVR. We can easily put it in the Asterisk Docker container by using a local Volume which contains all these voice files and is placed in the directory necessary for Asterisk to use it on the Docker system when the image is built.</p>

            <h3>Setting PJSIP and Redirect Settings</h3>
            <p>Both <code>PJSIP</code> and Redirect settings and simply set by writing to the corresponding configuration files in Asterisk. For both, the code then scans down the file, looks for particular lines where it needs to set settings and the replaces the line with the new line. We can then rewrite the data to the file, with the newly configured changes. Once the config files have been changed, we can then run the reload dialplan command for redirect settings and reload pjsip command for SIP trunk pjsip settings. We run these reload commands in Asterisk by connecting to the <code>AGI manager</code> using the python <code>pst2</code> library.</p>
